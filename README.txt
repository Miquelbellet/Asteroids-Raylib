In this first PEC 1, I tried to do a simple shooter game with some new features and mechanics to make the game more appealing to the player and to make it more playable.
I take as a reference the game "Asteroids" but I changed a lot of mechanics and logics that I did not like.
For the screen management I take as a reference the template "Advance_game" for the logic between screen transitions and global values.

Changed Mechanics:
- The player can move around with the keys [W, A, S, D].
- The player can aim the space ship in the direction that the pointer is going. The mouse controls the rotation of the ship.
- The asteroids did not appear on the opposite part of the screen when they go away, instead they bounce to the limits of the screen.
- The player has 3 lives, when he got hit by an asteroid, he loses 1 life.
- The game has 5 levels that go increasing the difficulty. If the player loses all his lives or complete all the levels, go to the ending screen.
- The score is the summation of all the destroyed asteroids, and the time score is the time that the player delay to loose all his lives or to beat the game.
- The highest score and his time score are saved in the memory of the device when the game is completed and the player beats the high score.

Game:
- All the screen backgrounds have been changed to a space image to make the game more appealing.
- The game has a special font for all the text that is shown.
- The game has a background music and a sound effect in every aspect of the game and every action that the player can do.
- In the menu screen, the player can change the music volume and the sound effects volume and this configuration are saved in the memory of the device.
- When the player is gaming, every some time, a boost object appears in the space and if the player catches it, he won, for a shot time, a triple shot projectile.

I hope that you enjoy the game!
